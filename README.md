# CarApp

This is a front-end application for managing cars. It allows you to fetch data from a REST API, add new cars, edit and delete existing cars. This project was created as a school assignment.

## To run the project, navigate to the project directory and run:

### npm start
This command will start the development server and open the application in your default browser at http://localhost:3000. The page will reload automatically when you make changes to the code.

You can also run the tests for the application using:

### npm test
This command will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode. You can learn more about running tests in the Create React App documentation.

To build the application for production, run:

### npm run build

This command will build the application in the production mode and optimize the build for the best performance. The output will be stored in the build folder. You can learn more about deployment in the Create React App documentation.

Please note that the command npm run eject is a one-way operation that cannot be undone. It is intended to give you full control over the project configuration, but you will be on your own after running it. You should not feel obligated to use this feature unless you are ready for it.
